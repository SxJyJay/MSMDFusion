## News
- (2022.8.11) Our MSMDFusion ranks 2nd and 1st in the term of NDS and mAP on the nuScenes leaderboard among all methods that don't use TTA and Ensemble. 
- (2022.11.12) Our improved version, MSMDFusion-base, ranks 1st in the term of NDS on the nuScenes leaderboard among all submissions that don't use TTA and Ensemble. MSMDFusion-base also achieve impressive results on the nuScenes tracking task by combining a simple greedy tracker. Please refer the paper [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03102) for more details.
- (2023.2.1) Simply combining the MSMDFusion-base with scaling and flipping test-time-augmentation, our MSMDFusion-TTA achieves non-trivial improvements (1.8 mAP and 1.1 NDS).
- ðŸ”¥(2023.2.28) MSMDFusion has been accepted by CVPR 2023!
